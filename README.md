# Coin Casino
This is a basic game that I created. You are given 100 coins and you try to push your luck as far as it will go without going out of money. I included some fun ASCII art titles for fun.

To play the game, clone the repo from GitHub and then simply run the downloaded executable, ```coinflip```.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TheRekrab/CoinCasino
```


If you are using Windows, then you will have to recompile the source code (```coinflip.c```) to a windows-friendly executable.

Once opening the game, you will be greeted with a cool ASCII art title.
You can choose whether or not you want to play:

```
[|=================================================================================|]
   //==\\  //==\\  ====  |\\ ||    //==\\  //-\\  //===   ====  |\\ ||  //==\\
   ||      ||  ||   ||   ||\\||    ||      ||=||  \\==\\   ||   ||\\||  ||  ||
   \\==//  \\==//  ====  || \\|    \\==//  || ||   ===//  ====  || \||  \\==//
[|=================================================================================|]


Welcome to the Coin Casino.
Would you like to play? (y/n):  y
```

Once the game starts, you can bet an amount of money on the coin flip.
Afterwards, you will be able to choose which side of the coin you think the coin will land on.

If you are right, then you will get the coins, but if you are wrong, then you will lose that many coins.
You can leave at any point in the game, but you will be forcefully kicked out if you lose all of your money.

```
[|===============================================================|]
   //==\\  //-\\  |\\  //|  ||==    //==\\  \\  //  ||==  ||=\\
   ||  __  ||=||  ||\\//||  ||=     ||  ||   \\//   ||=   ||=//
   \\==//  || ||  || \/ ||  ||==    \\==//    \/    ||==  || \\
[|===============================================================|]
```
That's basically all there is to the game. Enjoy!
